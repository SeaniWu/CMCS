# WARNING
- Due to changes to some TeX packages, the original template by https://github.com/kenfehling/latex-cheatsheet **does not render correctly** under current mainstream LaTeX distros.
- This is a revised edition that fixes the aforementioned problem, but may have introduced new compiling errors and inaccuracies caused by discrepancies of commands that the author has defined throughout the years. Reports about potential errors in the comment section are welcome. I do intend to complete and optimize the content structure of this project in the future.
